# Crownstone

Spice schemas of certain parts of the [crownstone](https://dobots.nl/products/crownstone.html).

## Installation

The scripts will probably help you a lot to see what kind of binaries I use. On an Ubuntu 14.04 system it is quite simple:

    sudo aptitude install geda gspiceui ngspice

By default `ngspiceui` comes with `gwave` as a dependency, however that program crashes on my system.

Thankfully, `ngspiceui` allows the user to set in `Settings | Preferences | Waveform viewer` a different viewer: `Gaw`. This viewer can be downloaded from [its creator](http://www.rvq.fr/php/ndl.php?id=gaw.?-.*).
